# Introduction

The Kangshi language, named after its usual autonym (Kangshi: _qc√±xswx_), which
literally means just "what is spoken", is one of the more important languages
spoken in the eastern reaches of the continent of Enzia around the year 1500 BE.
It is notable as the relative of the Old Kangshi language, which achieved
historical importance as the text of some of the most important religious texts
on the continent, including the _Mqczixtih Ihdzodj_, or "The Words of Creation",
that would later become the foundational scripture of Khaism, eventually being
translated into virtually all local literary languages of note.

Linguistically, Kangshi belongs to the northern branch of the Kangshuic family,
frequently also called "Kangshuic A" by specialists in the internal comparison
of this family. Kangshuic A is distinguished from other branches of Kangshuic by
its significant phonological and grammatical conservatism in terms of broad
structure, compensated by significant innovation in the details. The
phonological system of modern Kangshi, for example, is not far away from that
reconstructible for Proto-Kangshuic. However, the distribution of segments is
very distinct, as is the allophony exhibited.

Similarly, modern Kangshi does not distinguish a lot of different categories
from its ancestor, but it has abandoned entire types of ancestral morphology,
innovating new morphology from previously syntactic constructions.
