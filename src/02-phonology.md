# Kangshi Phonology

Kangshi is a very internally diverse languge, with several dozen mutually
intelligible, and yet distinct, varieties being spoken all over the Kangshi
language area. This document concerns the variety commonly known as Trade
Kangshi (Kangshi: _qÑxswx n ñpruj_ [qʰʌ̃ˤ^55^sˤɯ^52^ ŋ̩^11^ŋpʂu^12^]), specifically the merchant dialect of
Lwurlaw (Kangshi: _dBvgdauf_ [lβɤˤ^22^lɔ^35^]), one of the largest urban settlements in
Kangshi-speaking territories.

## Consonants

Lwurlaw Trade Kangshi, like most varieties of Kangshi, has a fairly small number
of phonemically distinct consonants. They are tabulated below in the customary
orthography:

              Labial  Alveolar  Retroflex   Velar        Uvular
------------  ------  --------  ---------  ---------  ----------
 Tenuis Stop    p        t                   k            q
 Voiced Stop    b        d
   Fricative             s                                χ
Voiced Fric.             z         ʐ                      ʁ
       Nasal    m        n                   ŋ
   
### Allophony

The realization of these phonemes is deeply dependent on context. There are a
few general rules:

The tenuis stops are generally realized as tenuis stops. When they occur in a
cluster before another consonant, they are usually aspirated.

The voiced stops /b d/ are realized as voiced stops following nasals, implosives
[ɓ ɗ] following voiceless consonants and resonants [β l] in most other contexts.

The fricative /ʐ/ devoices to [ʂ] adjacent to a voiceless consonant.

The uvular fricatives /χ ʁ/ often back to pharyngeals [ħ ʕ]. In clusters, this
often results in elision, leaving only pharyngealization of the surrounding
consonants and vowels.

The velar nasal undergoes place assimilation to uvular consonants, becoming [ɴ].
In syllabic position, but especially before /χ/, it then frequently debuccalizes
entirely, leaving behind a nasalized vowel [ʌ̃].

## Vowels

Unlike the consonants, the vowels of Lwurlaw Trade Kangshi correspond less well
to the customary orthography. The vowel phonemes are as follows:

              Front    Back Unrounded    Back Rounded
------------ -------  ----------------  --------------
        High   i           ɯ                  u
         Mid   e           ɤ                  o
    Near-Low   æ                              ɔ
         Low               ɑ
         
Additionally, the falling diphthongs /iə uə ɯə ɤi ɤu/ are distinguished. The
schwa element in the high-mid falling diphthongs is significantly affected by
the preceding vowel, and thus written with a distinct symbol; the beginning
vowel of the mid-high diphthongs is phonetically almost identical to the
standalone vowel /ɤ/ and is thus transcribed with the same symbol.

These vowels correspond to the customary orthography as follows:

 IPA    Orthography
-----  -------------
  i        i
  ɯ        w
  u        u
  e        e
  ɤ        v
  o        o
  æ        c
  ɔ        au
  ɑ        a
 iə       ic, ie
 uə        uo
 ɯə        wa
 ɤi       ci, ei
 ɤu        ou
         
## Tones

Lwurlaw Kangshi, like most other Kangshi varieties, has four lexical tones.
Every word has at most one tone-bearing syllable; toneless syllables receive
their tones based on the tones of the next relevant tone-bearing syllable.

The tones are written with letters following the tone-bearing syllable. They are
tabulated below:

        Tone   Contour    Orthography
------------  ---------  -------------
        High    55          n/a
         Low    12          -j
     Falling    52          -x
      Rising    35          -f
      
Historically, Kangshi words were strictly prefixing with obligatory final
stress, so the tone letter is written following the last syllable of the word.
Lwurlaw Trade Kangshi makes heavy use of a set of toneless suffixes for verbal
inflection; customarily, these suffixes are written as separate syllables.
